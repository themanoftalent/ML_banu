# ML_banu

For machine learning we will focus on some
fundamental concepts and algorithms. We will
use the Python programming language and the
NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib libraries. We
will also use the scikit-learn library, which
implements a large number of machine learning
algorithms and methods for model evaluation.
We will use the PyCharm IDE for writing and
running Python code. 

The important point is that we will not focus
on the details of the algorithms, but rather
on the concepts and ideas behind them. We
will also not focus on the details of the
libraries, but rather on the concepts and
ideas behind them. 

1. Importing data
2. Data preprocessing/cleaning data
3. Splitting data into training and test sets
4. Feature scaling
5. Create a model / Train the model
6. Make predictions/ evaluate the model
7. Hyperparameter tuning
8. Save and load a model
